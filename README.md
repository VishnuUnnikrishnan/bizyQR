bizyQR is a new way to share your contact information

It seems rather backward to have to give out business cards or recite out phone number, emails and addresses to share our contact details. Further in our ever greening world, printing out business cards is wasteful and inefficient.

To solve that pain point I built bizyQR. You enter your details and generate a QR-code that anyone can scan with their camera app and add your details.

Oh, Its all completely open source and free.
